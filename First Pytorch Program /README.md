# First PyTorch Program

 The following rudimentary model code is implemented from the PyTorch beginner's tutorial page: [PyTorch Quickstart Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html). The model is built to make predictions on the FashionMNIST dataset. This is equivalent to printing 'Hello World' in Python.

 I've included the development and understanding of the code in [First Pytorch Program.ipynb](First Pytorch Program /First PyTorch Program.ipynb).
